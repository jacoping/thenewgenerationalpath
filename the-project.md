This series of seminars documents a _journey_ through the discipline of **urbanism** intended as a *reflexive practice*{:.u}. The focus of the investigation is the **project** and the different forms and manifestations it has taken on, moving between two extremes: the identification of the elements of _continuity_ that can cross time, guaranteeing stability and recognisability to the discipline, and those, on the other hand, that are shaping the _new that is on the march_.

This series of seminars aims at revealing *issues*{:.u}, *tools*{:.u} and *alliances*{:.u} that shape the design process of different EU territories, investigating _emerging themes and questions_ of societal relevance that are orienting the urbanistic practice or that promoting new conceptual frames and practices, thus building a fertile ground for new concepts; analysing _images, concepts, models, strategies, and materials_ that urbanistic projects uses to understand, describe, interpret conceptualise and design the new reality of cities and territories; examining the _role of forces_ conditioning the urbanistic projects from an institutional, economic, and cultural point of view.

The overarching theme has been delimited in a loose manner with the aim to preserve the _kaleidoscopic nature_ of the Urbanistic Project. As a journey, this series is _open to the unexpected_ and _available to fascination_. Although not rigidly programmed, this *journey is*{:.u} *structured around three key elements*{:.u}.

The first one is intimately related to the conception of urbanism as a reflexive practice in which the _ways of knowing_ are linked to the _ways of designing_ in a constant interaction between praxis and theory. For this reason, the seminars are organized as a dialogue between a scholar and a practitioner (office) whose activity focuses on the same EU territory.

The second element includes the desire to investigate the paths opened in the last decade in professional practice, investigating the _condition of urbanistic projects in the contemporary world_. Even the most fundamental principles must be regularly adjusted and adapted to changing circumstances, and we seem to live in a moment in time in which the redefinition of debate in the public realm is a topic of remarkable importance. For these reasons, the practitioners selected for this journey represent young offices, mainly founded less than 10 years ago, which have already achieved international recognition by winning relevant competitions or awards, but which have not yet indulged in the self-referentiality that often characterises the most acclaimed international groups.

The last element explains the presence of the plural in the title of the event. In contemporary practices, projects of different scales and ambitions are showing _potential synergies between the consolidated disciplines of architecture, landscape and urban planning_. These synergies have promoted different urban paradigms in different contexts, which have produced new disciplines in their own right. Urban Design, Regional Design, Landscape Urbanism, Ecological urbanism, Landscape Infrastructure, Territorial Project today share the same unstable and hybrid ground in the process of city-making and territorial design. The aim of this series is not to define a new movement or establish a renewed understanding of the urbanistic  discipline, but to document the existence of this shared and plural ground, preserving the different gazes and paths that characterise it.  Each seminar, therefore, proposes a specific complementary combination of researcher and designer in order to account for the different nuances of the urbanistic discipline in each particular context.

Welcome to the **Urbanistic Projects / New Generational Paths** seminars series. Have a nice journeyâ€¦
