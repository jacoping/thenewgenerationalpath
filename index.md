title: The New Generational Paths / Seminar Series
---

Urbanism as spatial-oriented professional practice and theoretical reflection has changed. New ways of conceptualizing, describing and modifying EU cities and territories result from transformed urban conditions, material and immaterial. As a consequence a New Generation of Urbanistic Projects are emerging.

The seminar series *Urbanistic Projects / New&nbsp;Generational Paths*{:.u} scans the depth of the multilayered field of urbanism to detect elements of continuity and novelty. Organized as a dialogue between a Scholar and a young Practitioner (Office) whose activity focuses on the same EU territory, the seminar aims at revealing issues, tools and alliances that are specific and shared by contemporary EU territories.
