ALTITUDE 35 was founded in 2017 from landscape architects Clara Loukkal and Benoit Barnoud, in the center of Paris’s sport districts of Seine-Saint Denis, after a ten-years collaborate experience with Michel Desvigne Paysagiste and Agence Ter. At the crossroads between landscape and urbanism planning, Altitude 35 develops a systemic and multiscalar approach, based on geography as a lever for the production of the project, contrastingly with stardardization of city and territory. The office is  a three-time winner of the Europan Competition (13, 14, 15).

Ido Avissar is an architect-urbanist and doctor of architecture. From 2003 to 2009, he was project manager at the AUC for, among others, Greater Paris, Lille-Fives and the planning of a new city of 30,000 inhabitants on the island of Reunion. From 2009 to 2012, he was founding partner of the GRAU agency. In 2012, Ido Avissar created the LIST agency in which he develops an approach combining professional practice and research, and aims to position himself between disciplines – architecture, urbanism, landscape and planning – more than within a fixed disciplinary framework. He has also published numerous articles through which he explores in particular spatial, societal and territorial issues, questions that are also found in the themes of the projects on which he works and in his teaching.
